What do female respondents think about Virgin brand?"

Mode: rag

Among these responses, several distinct attitudes toward the Virgin brand appear: a set of respondents explicitly say they would not consider or choose Virgin, while others say they would consider Virgin only after most other brands or consider it equally with other brands. Some respondents express openness to considering Virgin but also indicate they do not prefer it over other brands, and a small subset reports only limited familiarity with the brand.

Some respondents express openness to considering Virgin but also indicate they do not prefer it over other brands, and a small subset reports only limited familiarity with the brand."
